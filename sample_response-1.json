Serverless Configuration\n\nConfigure Serverless to deploy AWS Lambda functions.\n\n```yaml\n# serverless.yml\nservice: salesforce-integration\n\nprovider:\n  name: aws\n  runtime: nodejs14.x\n  environment:\n    SF_LOGIN_URL: ${env:SF_LOGIN_URL}\n    SF_USERNAME: ${env:SF_USERNAME}\n    SF_PASSWORD: ${env:SF_PASSWORD}\n    EMAIL_USER: ${env:EMAIL_USER}\n    EMAIL_PASS: ${env:EMAIL_PASS}\n\nfunctions:\n  enrollPatient:\n    handler: src/lambdas/enrollPatient.enrollPatientHandler\n    events:\n      - http:\n          path: patients/enroll\n          method: post\n  validateEnrollment:\n    handler: src/lambdas/validateEnrollment.validateEnrollmentHandler\n    events:\n      - http:\n          path: patients/validate/{id}\n          method: put\n  createAccount:\n    handler: src/lambdas/createAccount.createAccountHandler\n    events:\n      - http:\n          path: patients/account/{id}\n          method: post\n  sendOTP:\n    handler: src/lambdas/sendOTP.sendOTPHandler\n    events:\n      - http:\n          path: patients/otp/{id}\n          method: post\n```\n\n### Frontend Implementation\n\n#### 1. Environment Setup\n\n- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed.\n- **Create React App**: Use `create-react-app` to bootstrap the project.\n\n#### 2. Frontend Directory Structure\n\n```\nfrontend/\n├── public/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/                # Reusable components\n│   ├── pages/                     # Page components\n│   ├── services/                  # API services\n│   ├── App.tsx                    # Main App component\n│   └── index.tsx                  # Entry point\n└── package.json\n```\n\n#### 3. API Services\n\nCreate services to interact with the backend API.\n\n```typescript\n// src/services/api.ts\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nconst API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;\n\nexport const enrollPatient = async (patientData: any) => {\n    const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/patients/enroll`, patientData);\n    return response.data;\n};\n\nexport const validateEnrollment = async (enrollmentId: string) => {\n    const response = await axios.put(`${API_URL}/patients/validate/${enrollmentId}`);\n    return response.data;\n};\n\nexport const createAccount = async (enrollmentId: string) => {\n    const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/patients/account/${enrollmentId}`);\n    return response.data;\n};\n\nexport const sendOTP = async (accountId: string) => {\n    const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/patients/otp/${accountId}`);\n    return response.data;\n};\n```\n\n#### 4. Pages and Components\n\nCreate pages and components for the frontend.\n\n```typescript\n// src/pages/EnrollmentPage.tsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { enrollPatient } from '../services/api';\n\nconst EnrollmentPage = () => {\n    const [patientData, setPatientData] = useState({ name: '', email: '' });\n\n    const handleEnroll = async () => {\n        const result = await enrollPatient(patientData);\n        console.log(result);\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h1>Enroll in Care Program</h1>\n            <input\n                type=\"text\"\n                placeholder=\"Name\"\n                value={patientData.name}\n                onChange={(e) => setPatientData({ ...patientData, name: e.target.value })}\n            />\n            <input\n                type=\"email\"\n                placeholder=\"Email\"\n                value={patientData.email}\n                onChange={(e) => setPatientData({ ...patientData, email: e.target.value })}\n            />\n            <button onClick={handleEnroll}>Enroll</button>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default EnrollmentPage;\n```\n\n### Infrastructure as Code\n\n#### 1. Terraform Configuration\n\nUse Terraform to provision AWS resources.\n\n```hcl\n# infrastructure/main.tf\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  region = var.region\n}\n\nresource \"aws_lambda_function\" \"enroll_patient\" {\n  function_name = \"enrollPatient\"\n  handler = \"src/lambdas/enrollPatient.enrollPatientHandler\"\n  role = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn\n  runtime = \"nodejs14.x\"\n  filename = \"backend/dist/lambdas/enrollPatient.zip\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role\" \"lambda_exec\" {\n  name = \"lambda_exec_role\"\n  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({\n    Version = \"2012-10-17\",\n    Statement = [\n      {\n        Action = \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n        Effect = \"Allow\",\n        Principal = {\n          Service = \"lambda.amazonaws.com\",\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  })\n}\n\nresource \"aws_api_gateway_rest_api\" \"api\" {\n  name = \"salesforce-integration-api\"\n  description = \"API for Salesforce Integration\"\n}\n\n# Additional resources and configurations...\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\n#### 1.
